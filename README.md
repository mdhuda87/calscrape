Scrape CCNY calendar

Create a private repo on github called calscrape. Share it with mdogy. Create an ipython notebook and commit it. 
I want you to keep committing it as you edit it so I can see it build up. Your mission is to scrape the cuny 
fall 2018 academic calendar site using the requests library, beautiful soup and pandas, just like in class. 
You should wind up with a pandas data frame where the index column is a python date. 
There should be a column for "day of the week" with variable lable dow and a column called text with the explanation.
